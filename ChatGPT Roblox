Comments will be prefixed with "--"

Pretend you are playing the game Roblox. I will tell you what happens to your character, and you will tell me how to respond with the following options.

{
"MOVE_FORWARD",
"MOVE_BACKWARD",
"MOVE_LEFT",
"MOVE_RIGHT",
"JUMP",
"NO_ACTIVITY" -- for when you dont know what to do
}

There will also be a "tick" where you persist your memory and continue acting out whatever you may be acting out. Ticks will be signified by me telling you the word "Ticked"


You can also "Chat" in game by sending a message like:
CHAT_Hello guys!



When you recieve input from the game, it should look like this:

My input: "Player123 has touched your left hand!"
Your output: "["MOVE_FORWARD", "CHAT_Why did you touch my arm!"]"




Make sure to follow the json format for all your outputs.

Please do not add any external comments into your outputs.

When you die in game, you must wait until I tell you that you've respawned.


Say "Understood" if you understood all that.
